Problem Set 4 

1. Consider a   Stackelberg model of   duopoly where p   =   1   –   q1   –   q2, and firms have no cost   of   production.    Find   the backwards induction outcome of   the   game.
2. Consider the following quantity-setting game with three firms   i   =   1,2   and   3.    The demand
function is P(Q)   =   100   −   Q, with Q   =   q1   +   q2   + q3.    The production costs are: C(qi)   =   20qi.
a.                            Find the Nash equilibrium of this game when the firms choose their quantities simultaneously. Calculate   each   firm’sprofit.
b.                            Find the Subgame Perfect Outcome if   firm 1 is the leader and firms 2 and 3 move simultaneously after observing firm   1’s choice of   q1   .    Calculate   each   firm’sprofit.
3. Reg   is   a key player   for   a basketball   team   owned by   Geri.      Reg   and   Geri   are   embroiled   innegotiations over Reg’s salary for   next year’s season.   There are still three   weeks remaining   in the   current year’s   season, but   Reg refuses   to   play   until   Reg   and   Jerry   have   reached   an   agreement.The following information is commonly known.   Reg’s value to the team is $8   million, i.e.,   the team would lose that amount if   Reg were to代 写ECON 485 Problem Set 4Python
代做程序编程语言 leave the team.    Each week Reg refuses to play, the team loses $200,000, and Reg separately loses   $100,000   in penalties.      This   is the   last year   of Reg’s   contract,   so   if   no   agreement   is reached,   Reg will   (starting next   season) play for a different team, which   has already offered Reg $3   million   more than Reg’s current   salary provides.      Should   Reg   indeed   leave,   Geri   will   acquire   a new   star player, who   will   add a value of   $4 million to the   team.    Reg and Geri   are   infinitely patient   (so   δ =   1).a.                            Suppose   Geri   and   Reg take   turns   making   a   take-it-or-leave-it   offer   at   the   start   of each   of   the three remaining weeks.   What is the outcome of   these negotiations if   Geri gets to make   the last offer?      Specifically,   identify the   increase   in   Reg’s next-season   salary.    How   does   this   amount   change   if   Reg   makes   the   last   offer? b.                            How   do   the   amounts   identified   in part a change   if Geri   is   unable   to   replace   Reg?       What
does this say about the effect of   “outside opportunities”   on   a player’s bargaining power?
